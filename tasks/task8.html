        <h2 class="t7c1">The Art of Homemade Pizza</h2>


<p class="mid"> Nothing beats the comforting aroma of freshly baked pizza. Crafting your own pizza at home lets you experiment with a variety 
of toppings and crust styles.
From a classic <span class="t7c2">MARGHERITA</span>  to a hearty meat lover's delight, the possibilities are endless. Start with a
 perfectly kneaded dough, spread a rich tomato sauce, sprinkle mozzarella, and top with your favorite ingredients.
  Baking pizza in a hot oven ensures a crispy crust and gooey cheese, creating a culinary masterpiece that's both fun to 
  make and delicious to eat.</p>

       <h2 class="t7c1">A Symphony of Flavors: Mediterranean Salads
    </h2>
    
<p class="mid"> Mediterranean salads are a celebration of fresh, healthy, and vibrant ingredients. A classic 
    option like the <span class="t7c2">GREEK  SALAD </span> 
    combines crisp cucumbers, juicy tomatoes, and tangy feta cheese, drizzled with olive oil and sprinkled with
      oregano. Add a handful of olives for an authentic touch. Another favorite is the <span  span class="t7c2">TABBOULEH</span> TABBOULEH, a 
      parsley-based salad 
      with bulgur wheat, mint, and lemon juice. These salads are perfect as a light meal or a flavorful side dish,
       embodying the simplicity and richness of Mediterranean cuisine. </p>
